# stata.vim

Syntax file for editing Stata ado, do, and Mata source files.

Some mappings I find specifically useful while editing ado, do, and Mata
source files.

## Installation

I use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
to install Vim plugins.
If you do too, then you can use the following to install this plugin:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/jpitblado/vim-stata.git stata
```

## Future plans

Update the syntax file to conform with the current Stata release.
Right now the list of recognized Stata functions came from Stata 9.
